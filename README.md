#C++LinkedList
## Disclaimer
This is an implementation of the common linked list class in C++. This project was originally created as an exercise for an university exam. The implementation works but is not proven to be safe and therefore should not be used in any project.
## How to use
As staten above, this should not be used, but if you want to, you can just grab the correct library and implementation file for your needs (with or without class templates) and slap it inside a C++ project. Then just #include in you main.cpp and use the embedded functions.
